# twitter-search-app

This app is created using React and Redux libraries while demonstrating advance javascript concepts like prototypal inheritance, generators, promises etc.
It uses Twit library as a middleware to make connection between app and the twitter API. 

It also uses another advance concept called '[React-Virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized)', which takes care of rendering a very large amount of dataset (list of tweets in our scenario)
while giving same performance even on low-spec systems as on high-end systems by drastically cutting the DOM load time in user's browser.
